	  <p id="summary">This book details how to build and calibrate custom 3D printers, and it teaches the basics of modeling in order to create 3D printed objects.</p>
        <h3>Related Websites</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a></li>
	  <p id="summary">The official documentation of the Rust programming language.
	    The documentation contains an extensive introduction to the language and many tutorials.
	    It has an API with examples for the standard library and examples of common patterns.
	    The documentation also has a book that discusses some of the history of Rust and the basic ideas behind it.
	    In addition, the documentation has descriptions of language specific tools such as Rustâ€™s package manager, Cargo.
	    Cargo allows the inclusion of 3rd party libraries simply by adding a line to a config file.</p>
          <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/documentation">Git</a></li>
	  <p id="summary">The documentation for the version control system git.
	    It contains a book with detailed examples and use cases of how to use git to do things such as create project branches or revert commits.
	    It also has cheat sheets that describe most of the basic git commands and options.
	    Our team is using git to back up our work on github so we do not lose work, and we are using the branching feature to develop features on different branches.
	    This keeps our project modular and conflict free.</p>
          <li><a href="https://designmakeshare.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/machinekit-delta-configuration-calibration/ ">MachineKit Installation Guide</a></li>
	  <p id="summary"> A tutorial from a hobbyist that describes how to get MachineKit running on a single board computer in order to run a 3D delta printer.
	    The tutorial describes how to download the repository, how to get the necessary measures, and how to properly edit the config files.
	    Tutorials like this help us know what steps of the installation can and cannot be automated.
	    When our application builds the software, it will probably follow an algorithm similar to the steps listed in this tutorial.

          <li><a href="http://www.machinekit.io/docs/home/">MachineKit Documentation</a></li>
	  <p id="summary">MachineKit provides a method for linux computers to interface with hardware for machine control applications.
	    The documentation of the MachineKit project has instructions for building and installing the project from source onto a debian based linux system.
	    The documentation is also convenient enough to include information about related material such as what is the hardware abstraction layer, and how it is configured.
	    There is no documentation of APIs but links are provided to the source code and the MachineKit user group. </p>
